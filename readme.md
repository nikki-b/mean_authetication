# MEAN Stack User Authentication with Passport

Modified from https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local.
For a detailed step-by-step, follow the scotch.io tutorial.

My version will use local, Facebook, Twitter, and Google login/reg - with the full MEAN stack (including the AngularJS part). The file structure will NOT match the scotch tutorial as I have modified it quite a bit while building.
